        <h3> About </h3>

        <p> Will Lennon is a writer and journalist based in Washington D.C. After spending several nomadic years traveling, working
            and writing about music as a freelancer, Will settled in the District in 2016... just in time to witness Donald
            Trump's upset victory in the 2016 election. Since then, he has graduated cum laude from The School of Media and Public 
            Affairs at the George Washington University and trained extensively as an investigative reporter. For local and national outlets,
            he has covered local homicides, federal politics, ICE raids, immigration and campaign finance. He has also completed
            trainings in Freedom of Information journalism and open source investigations. One of his investigations for Washington City Paper
            revealed the extent to which local public safety agencies collaborated with ICE. (<a href= "https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/PR23-0501">
            D.C. law was amended </a> to restrict such collaboration as a result of the investigation.) He is currently learning web design (slowly, as you can see)
            and writing short stories.
