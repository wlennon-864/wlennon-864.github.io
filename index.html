        <h3> About </h3>

        <p> Will Lennon is a writer and journalist based in Washington D.C. After spending several years traveling, working
            and writing about music as a freelancer, Will settled in the District in 2016... just in time to witness Donald
            Trump's upset victory in November. Since then, he graduated cum laude from The School of Media and Public 
            Affairs at the George Washington University and trained extensively as an investigative reporter. For local and national outlets,
            he has covered politics, homicides, ICE raids, immigration, campaign finance and more. He has also completed
            trainings in Freedom of Information journalism and open source investigations. One of his investigations for Washington City Paper
            revealed the extent to which local public safety agencies collaborated with ICE. (<a href= "https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/PR23-0501">
            D.C. law was amended </a> to restrict such collaboration as a result of the investigation.) He is currently learning web design 
            (slowly, as you can see) and writing short stories.
