        <h3> Bio </h3>

        <p> Will Lennon is a writer and journalist based in Washington D.C. Will moved to the District in 2016, just in time to witness Donald Trump's upset victory in November. 
            Since then, he has graduated with a degree in journalism and mass communication from The School of Media and Public 
            Affairs at The George Washington University. For local and national outlets, he has covered politics, homicides, ICE raids, immigration, campaign finance and more. 
            He has also completed trainings in freedom of information journalism and open source investigations.  
            One of his investigations for Washington City Paper revealed the extent to which local agencies collaborated with ICE.
            <a href= "https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/PR23-0501"> D.C. law was amended </a> to restrict such collaboration as a result of the investigation. On January 6, 2021, he covered the pro-Trump riots
            from the lawn of the U.S. Capitol. Currently, Will attends the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy as a graduate student 
            focused on <a href="https://spp.umd.edu/your-education/masters/mppmpm-specializations"> international security and economic policy</a>. 
          </p>

                <strong> Military and security applications for Artificial Intelligence </strong>

                </br>
            
                Vladmir Putin believes that whoever is first to master militarized Artificial Intelligence will
                become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251226/russia-ai-putin-rule-the-world">"ruler of the world"</a>. 
                We can't know for sure how AI will shape geopolitics in the coming decades, but that won't stop governments and corporations from doing all they 
                can to be first across the finish line. The United States and China are considered frontrunners, 
                but revolving door politics and lobbying in the U.S. might allow other parties  to pull 
                ahead. Although AI does have promising applications (the United Nations uses it to <a href="http://www.unicri.it/news/AI-Safer-Children-Online"> 
                investigate child abuse</a>) it also poses threats to privacy and human rights.

                about how an AI-based surveillance system developed by Anduril industries could 
                increase mortality rates among migrants at the southern U.S. border. The interactive map below illustrates the web of corporate and government 
                interests I uncovered in my investigation. Going forward, I'm interested in writing about tech companies
                developing AI systems for authoritarian and undemocratic governments. If you have any tips or ideas, please do not

        <strong> Geolocating police violence in Colombia, 2021 </strong>
      
        </br>
        </br>

                <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/06/americas/colombia-protests-explainer-intl-latam/index.html"> A protest movement erupted across Colombia's major cities </a> 
                in the spring of 2021, after then-President Iv√°n Duque introduced a series fiscal reforms.
                The police crackdown was swift and severe, sparking a cycle of violence that continued even after the proposed reforms were withdrawn. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/15/colombian-forces-committed-serious-abuses-during-protests-un"> 
                At least 28 people were killed</a>. There were <a href="https://colombiareports.com/protests-in-colombia-turn-deadly-police-massacres-at-least-8-in-cali/"> reports of a secretive riot police 
                unit </a> known as ESMAD being involved in the suppression of the demonstrations. 

            </br>
            </br>
                
                That summer, I worked part time as a volunteer researcher for <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/about/"> Bellingcat</a>, a group of investigators using open source intelligence (OSINT)
                to investigate spies, governments and criminal networks. While volunteering for Bellingcat, I used geolocation to pinpoint instances of 
                police violence against protestors in Colombia. The incidents I geolocated were incorporated into the <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/05/10/a-new-platform-maps-colombias-escalating-police-violence/"> 
                Geografia de Violencia Policial </a> (Cartography of Police Violence) project.

                <strong> Tracking homicides in Washington D.C., 2018 </strong>
                </br>
                </br> 
                    In 2018, I participated in an unpaid summer internship at <a href="https://dcwitness.org/"> D.C. Witness </a>. At D.C. Witness, I reported on homicides in the District of Columbia and covered 
                    <a href="http://dcwitness.org/jury-finds-defendants-guilty-in-apartment-stabbing/"> a trial in which three men were found 
                    guilty of felony murder</a>. I also worked on a project tracking where people convicted of homicide in the District were being incarcerated. My bylines have since been removed from the site. 
                    In many cases, my name has been replaced with "D.C. Witness Staff," in spite of the fact that I only ever
                    worked for D.C. Witness as an intern. Using the Wayback Machine, one can still see some (but not all) of the stories I wrote for the site with my byline
                     properly attached. (See links below.) I also have extensive notes proving that I was present at dozens of hearings and trials (pictured left) and copies of weekly "progress report" forms I 
                    was required to fill out throughout the internship. The progress reports show what I was working on and when. I have also <a href="https://twitter.com/WillKosh/status/1536126072743510016"> written a Twitter thread about this</a>.
