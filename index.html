        <h3> About </h3>

        <p> Will Lennon is a writer and journalist based in Washington D.C. After spending six years traveling, working
            and writing about music as a freelancer, Will settled in the District in 2016, just in time to witness Donald
            Trump's upset victory in November. Since then, he has graduated from The School of Media and Public 
            Affairs at The George Washington University and trained extensively as an investigative reporter. For local and national outlets,
            he has covered politics, homicides, ICE raids, immigration, campaign finance and more. He has also completed
            trainings in freedom of information journalism and open source investigations. One of his investigations for Washington City Paper
            revealed the extent to which local public safety agencies collaborated with ICE. <a href= "https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/PR23-0501">
            D.C. law was amended </a> to restrict such collaboration as a result of the investigation. On January 6, 2021, he covered the pro-Trump riots
            from the lawn of the U.S. Capitol.

                Vladmir Putin believes that whoever is first to master militarized Artificial Intelligence will
                become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251226/russia-ai-putin-rule-the-world">"ruler of the world."</a> 
                We can't yet know for sure how AI will shape the world in the coming decades, but that won't stop governments and corporations from doing all they 
                can to be the first across the finish line. The United States and China are considered frontrunners, 
                but revolving door politics and lobbying in the U.S. might allow other interests to pull 
                ahead. Although AI does have promising applications (the United Nations uses AI to <a href="http://www.unicri.it/news/AI-Safer-Children-Online"> 
                investigate child abuse</a>) it also poses threats to privacy and human rights.

                about how an AI-based surveillance system developed by Anduril industries could 
                increase mortality rates among migrants at the southern U.S. border. The interactive map below illustrates the web of corporate and government 
                interests I uncovered in my investigation. Going forward, I'm interested in writing about tech companies
                developing AI systems for authoritarian and undemocratic governments. If you have any tips or ideas, please do not

                <strong> D.C. Witness, 2018 </strong>
                </br>
                </br> 
                    In 2018, I participated in an unpaid summer internship at D.C. Witness. While at D.C. Witness, I reported on homicides in the District of Columbia. 
                    I also covered a trial in which three men were found guilty of felony murder from beginning to end, and worked on a project tracking where people convicted of 
                    homicides in D.C. were incarcerated. My bylines have since been removed from the site. In many cases, my name has been replaced with "D.C. Witness Staff," in spite of the fact that I only ever
                    worked for D.C. Witness as an intern. Using the Wayback Machine, one can still see some (but not all) of the stories I wrote for the site with my byline
                    still properly attached. (See links below.) I also have extensive notes proving that I was present at dozens of hearings and trials (pictured left) and copies of weekly "progress report" forms I 
                    was required to fill out throughout the internship. The progress reports show what I was working on and when. I have also <a href="https://twitter.com/WillKosh/status/1536126072743510016"> written about this on Twitter. </a>
