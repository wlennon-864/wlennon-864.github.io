        <h3> About </h3>

        <p> Will Lennon is a writer and journalist based in Washington D.C. After spending several years traveling, working
            and writing about music as a freelancer, Will settled in the District in 2016... just in time to witness Donald
            Trump's upset victory in November. Since then, he graduated cum laude from The School of Media and Public 
            Affairs at The George Washington University and trained extensively as an investigative reporter. For local and national outlets,
            he has covered politics, homicides, ICE raids, immigration, campaign finance and more. He has also completed
            trainings in Freedom of Information journalism and open source investigations. One of his investigations for Washington City Paper
            revealed the extent to which local public safety agencies collaborated with ICE. <a href= "https://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/PR23-0501">
            D.C. law was amended </a> to restrict such collaboration as a result of the investigation. He is currently learning web design 
            (slowly, as you can see) and writing short stories.

            <h4> Military and security applications for artificial intelligence </h4>
                <p> 
                According to Vladmir Putin, whoever is first to master militarized Artificial Intelligence will
                become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251226/russia-ai-putin-rule-the-world">"ruler of the world."</a> 
                We can't yet know for sure the true limits and potential of
                AI, but that won't stop the world's governments and corporations from doing all they 
                can to be the first across the finish line. The United States and China are considered frontrunners, 
                but revolving door politics and lobbying in the U.S. pose a danger of allowing other countries to pull 
                ahead. Although AI does have positive applications (the United Nations uses AI tech to <a href="http://www.unicri.it/news/AI-Safer-Children-Online"> 
                investigate child abuse</a>) it also poses threats to privacy and human rights. 
                <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2021/04/08/the-virtual-wall-documents-show-cbp-plans-for-surveillance-towers-at-us-mexico-border/">I wrote for Shadowproof</a>
                about how an AI-based surveillance system at the U.S. southern border could 
                incrase the number of migrant deaths. Going forward, I'm interested in writing about tech companies
                developing AI systems for authoritarian and undemocratic governments. If you have any tips or ideas, please do not
